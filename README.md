To run this store you can just run the `make` command and then type ./a.out into a console.
To change what you are selling go into main.cpp and edit the line with "Cupcakes" into what it is you are selling, the "2.99" for price, and the "100" for amount you are selling. Make sure you rerun `make`
When finished you can remove the a.out file
